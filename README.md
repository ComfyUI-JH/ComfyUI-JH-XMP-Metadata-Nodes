# JH XMP Metadata Nodes

Custom nodes for loading and saving images with embedded XMP metadata (https://www.adobe.com/products/xmp.html).

When XMP metadata is present in a file, both macOS and Windows index it automatically, making it searchable from the Finder on the Mac or the File Explorer in Windows.

Apps like Photoshop and Lightroom expose XMP metadata and allow it to be edited.

# Getting Started

## Installing from GitHub

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

2. Clone this repository into the `custom_nodes` folder:

    ```
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/ComfyUI-JH/ComfyUI_JH_XMP_Metadata_Nodes.git
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages. If you're using `venv` and `pip` that looks like this:

    ```
    cd ComfyUI_JH_Misc_Nodes
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you're using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), then it's just

    ```
    cd ComfyUI_JH_Misc_Nodes
    poetry install
    ```

# Nodes

## Load Image With XMP Metadata

<div align="center">
    <img width="1128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ce6fbf8-7d35-4041-9e22-2841fb1d1239" align="middle" />
</div>

<br />

Just like the built-in **Load Image** node except if XMP metadata is embedded in the image it will be parsed and made available on the node's outputs. The **xml_string** output carries the entire XML data structure including metadata which is not specifically supported by this package.

## Save Image With XMP Metadata

<div align="center">
    <img width="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09934810-bdda-4333-9fcd-340f415222c3" align="middle" />
</div>

<br />

Saves any images piped into it with embedded XMP metadata. All inputs (except **images**) are optional. Can save in a variety of file formats: JPEG, PNG (with and without embedding the ComfyUI workflow), WebP (lossy and lossless).

## Get Widget Value

<div align="center">
    <img width="1035" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f77b5747-3270-4007-b569-f77c81e01311" align="middle" />
</div>

<br />

Can be used to get the **string**, **int** or **float** value of any widget on any node. Simply pipe the node into this node's input and type in the name of the widget you want the value of.

## Path to Stem

<div align="center">
    <img width="1281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9541de76-2b1b-41af-820c-ab535404fd63" align="middle" />
</div>

<br />

Given a path string (absolute or relative), this node returns the "stem," meaning the filename alone minus any extension.

## Format Metadata

<div align="center">
    <img width="633" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be86083-6c3d-48f6-a0b5-60d45202af3c" />
</div>

<br />

This utility node takes common workflow inputs (prompt, model_name, seed, etc.) and allows you to construct a string that can subsequently be piped into a **Save Image With XMP Metadata** node input to embed metadata however you choose.
